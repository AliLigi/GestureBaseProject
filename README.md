##Requirements for the project 
####Project for Gesture Based UI Development

Develop an application to demonstrate the use of gestures.  You have a choice of technologies available to you and an opportunity to combine a lot of technology that you have worked with over the past four years.
At the very least, this should be a local implementation of the application using gestures to interact with it.  You can expand out to include real-world hardware and use this as an opportunity to prove a concept.  The Internet of Things is a common phrase, so you could implement a solution taking advantage of hardware like the Raspberry Pi, using the cloud for data transfer and creating a real-world scenario through this medium.  
The programming language is your choice and there are several options including JavaScript, C#, C++ and Lua.
